# Module 9: Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview:

This analysis parses Hawaiian weather data to determine if a surf/ice cream shop is a sustainable year-round venture.  In order to determine the viability of this business venture, summary statistics were computed on weather data for the months of [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_query.png) and [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_query.png).  

## Results:
* With an average temperature of approximately 75 degrees in [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_stats.png) and 71 degrees in [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_stats.png), a year-round surf/ice cream shop could potentially be a viable business venture. Both months have an average temperature above 70 degrees, and warmer weather typically encourages consumers to participate in outdoor activities and enjoy cold treats.

* In June, the minimum temperature is around 64 degrees, indicating that some consumers may still participate in outdoor activities even on colder days. However, in December, the minimum temperature is approximately 56 degrees, making it less likely for consumers to frequent a surf/ice cream shop during colder periods.

* With a maximum temperature of around 85 degrees in June and 83 degrees in December, it's likely that customers would be inclined to participate in surfing and indulge in ice cream during these warmer periods.

## Summary:

According to the data, opening a surf shop/ice cream shop in Hawaii appears to be a feasible year-round business. The average temperatures in June and December are in the 70s, with maximum temperatures reaching the 80s, which makes consumers more inclined to engage in outdoor activities and enjoy ice cream. Although the minimum temperatures suggest that the business may be less active at times, it's important to note that these periods are infrequent and do not render the business unviable.

While this information provides a good starting point for decision-making, further investigation is necessary. W. Avey could delve deeper into the data to determine the number of days each month at the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures. A histogram could visualize this information to illustrate the historical temperature fluctuations in June and December. Moreover, it may be useful to run the same temperature statistics while considering longitude, latitude, and elevation, as some Oahu beaches may be cooler or warmer depending on their location.

Additionally, it would be valuable to gather summary statistics on other weather conditions, such as cloudiness, humidity, and wind chill factor, for June and December, as these factors may also affect consumer behavior. By cross-referencing these conditions with temperature, the number of days at specific temperatures under cloudy or humid conditions could be determined. However, it's important to note that a different data set would be necessary since this information is not included in the current data set.
