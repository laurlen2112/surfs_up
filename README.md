# Module 9: Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview:

This analysis parses Hawaiian weather data to determine if a surf shop/ice cream shop is a sustainable year-round venture.  In order to determine the viability of this business venture, summary statistics were computed on weather data for the months of [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_query.png) and [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_query.png).  

## Results:

* The mean temperature for the month of [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_stats.png) is about 75 degrees.  The mean temperature for the month of [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_stats.png) is about 71 degrees.  Based on this datapoint a year-round surf/ice cream shop might be viable because the average temperature for each month is above 70 degrees and warmer weather may prompt consumers to engage in outdoor activities and consumer cold foods.

* The minimum temperature for June is about 64 degrees, while the minimum temperature for December is about 56 degrees.  The minimum temperatures for both months indicate that on the coldest days of the month consumers might not engage in outdoor activity.  This is particularly true for December which has a minimum temperature about 12 degrees lower than June's minimum temperature.

* The maximum temp for June is about 85 degrees, while the maximum temp for December is about 2 degrees lower at 83.  These temperatures suggest that customers would engage in surfing and ice cream consumption.

## Summary:

The data indicates that a surf shop/ice cream shop would be a viable year round business in Hawaii since the average December temperature is only about 4 degrees lower than the average June temperature.  It is reasonable to infer that most consumers may not engage in beach activities when the temperature is in the 60s, so colder June days and colder December days are not likely to be profitable.  Finally, the maximun temperature for both months is in the 80s.  Temperatures in the 80s likely prompt consumers to engage in outdoor activities and comsumption of ice cream.

While this data provides a good starting point, drilling down on this data would assist in the decision making process.  For example, a count can be performed to find the number of days per month the temperature is at minimum.  If the historical temperature is at or near minimum for the majority of the month, this business may not have year-round viability.  Converesely, a count should be performed to understand how many days per month temperature is a maximum because it is possible that the hotter days could encourage high customer activity and offset the colder days. Additionally, summary statistics should be captured on other weather conditions such as cloudiness, rain, and wind chill factor since these conditions may influence consumers' behavior.  Finally, W.Avey shoud consider doing this analysis on other months to provide a general picture of what to expect in regards to weather.
