# Module 9: Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview:

This analysis parses Hawaiian weather data to determine if a surf/ice cream shop is a sustainable year-round venture.  In order to determine the viability of this business venture, summary statistics were computed on weather data for the months of [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_query.png) and [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_query.png).  

## Results:

* The mean temperature for the month of [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_stats.png) is about 75 degrees.  The mean temperature for the month of [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_stats.png) is about 71 degrees.  Based on this datapoint, a year-round surf/ice cream shop might be viable because the average temperature for each month is above 70 degrees and warmer weather generally prompts consumers to engage in outdoor activities and consumer cold foods.

* The minimum temperature for June is about 64 degrees.  June's minimum temperature is high enough to predict that some consumers may engage in outdoor activities during the colder days of June.  By contrast, the minimum temperature for December is about 56 degrees and it seems less likely that consumers would patronize a surf/ice cream shop during December's colder days.  

* The maximum temp for June is about 85 degrees and the maximum temp for December is about 2 degrees lower at 83.  These temperatures suggest that customers would engage in surfing and ice cream consumption.

## Summary:

The data indicates that a surf shop/ice cream shop would be a viable year round business in Hawaii since the average temperatures in June and December temperature are in the 70s.  Also, the maximum temperature for both months is in the 80s, which will likely prompt consumers to engage in outdoor activities and consumption of ice cream.  Finally, while business may slow during the colder days of the month, the minimum temps found in this analysis do not make the business unviable.  

This data provides a good starting point.  However, additional queries should be conducted to assist in the decision making process. For example, W. Avey could drill down on this data to find the number of days per month at the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures.  This information could be visualized as a histogram to show temperature change throughout the month.  This analysis would indicate temperature fluctuation patterns during the month and help W. Avey anticipate when the shop would see less customers.  Additionally, summary statistics should be captured on other weather conditions such as cloudiness, rain, and wind chill factor for June and December since these conditions may influence consumers' behavior.  These conditions can be cross-referenced with temperature to glean the how many days were at a specific temperature and cloudy or how many days were at specific temperature and rainy because both weather conditions and temperature would influence consumer behavior.  Finally, W. Avey should consider doing this analysis on other months of the year to provide a fuller picture of what to expect in regards to weather.
