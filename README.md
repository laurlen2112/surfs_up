# Module 9: Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview:

This analysis parses Hawaiian weather data to determine if a surf shop/ice cream shop is a sustainable year-round venture.  In order to determine the viability of this business venture, summary statistics were computed on weather data for the months of [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_query.png) and [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_query.png).  

## Results:

* The mean temperature for the month of [June](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/june_stats.png) is about 75 degrees.  The mean temperature for the month of [December](https://github.com/laurlen2112/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_stats.png) is about 71 degrees.  Based on this datapoint, a year-round surf/ice cream shop might be viable because the average temperature for each month is above 70 degrees and warmer weather may prompt consumers to engage in outdoor activities and consumer cold foods.

* The minimum temperature for June is about 64 degrees, while the minimum temperature for December is about 56 degrees.  The minimum temperatures for both months indicate that on the coldest days of the month consumers might not engage in outdoor activities.  This is particularly true for December which has a minimum temperature about 12 degrees lower than June's minimum temperature.

* The maximum temp for June is about 85 degrees, while the maximum temp for December is about 2 degrees lower at 83.  These temperatures suggest that customers would engage in surfing and ice cream consumption.

## Summary:

The data indicates that a surf shop/ice cream shop would be a viable year round business in Hawaii since the average temperatures in June and December temperature are in the 70s.  Also, the maximum temperature for both months is in the 80s, which will likely prompt consumers to engage in outdoor activities and consumption of ice cream.  Finally, it should be noted that the minimum temperature ranges from the mid-50s to the mid-60s, it is expected that colder days would not prompt consumers to engage in outdoor activities so colder days are not likely to be profitable. 

While this data provides a good starting point, additional queries would assist in the decision making process. For example, W. Avey could drill down on this data to find number of days at specific temperatures.  This information would provide an indication of temperature fluctuations during the month.  Additionally, summary statistics should be captured on other weather conditions such as cloudiness, rain, and wind chill factor since these conditions may influence consumers' behavior.  These conditions can be cross-referenced with temperature to glean the how many days were at a specific temperature and cloudy or how many days were at specific temperature and rainy because both weather conditions and temperature would influence consumer behavior.  Finally, W.Avey should consider doing this analysis on other months of the year to provide a fuller picture of what to expect in regards to weather.
